## Schema

### Optional

- `applied_globally` (Boolean) Filter exclusions by whether they are applied globally. All provided filter attributes must match for an exclusion to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `created_by` (String) Filter exclusions by the user who created them. All provided filter attributes must match for an exclusion to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `filter` (String) FQL filter to apply to the sensor visibility exclusions query. When specified, only exclusions matching the filter will be returned. Cannot be used together with 'ids' or other filter attributes. Example: `applied_globally:true`
- `ids` (List of String) List of sensor visibility exclusion IDs to retrieve. When specified, only exclusions with matching IDs will be returned. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or other filter attributes.
- `modified_by` (String) Filter exclusions by the user who last modified them. All provided filter attributes must match for an exclusion to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `sort` (String) Sort order for the results. Valid values include field names with optional '.asc' or '.desc' suffix. Example: 'value.asc', 'created_on.desc'
- `value` (String) Filter exclusions by the exclusion value/path. All provided filter attributes must match for an exclusion to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
