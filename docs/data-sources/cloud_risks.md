# crowdstrike_cloud_risks (Data Source)

This data source retrieves cloud risks with full details based on filters and sort criteria. Cloud risks represent security findings and misconfigurations detected in cloud environments. For advanced queries, use Falcon Query Language (FQL) filters. For more information, refer to the [Cloud Risks API documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/ed2aed27/cloud-risks).

## API Scopes

The following API scopes are required:

- Cloud Security Risks | Read
- Cloud Security Assets | Read


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Query all high severity risks
data "crowdstrike_cloud_risks" "high_severity" {
  filter = "severity:'High'"
  sort   = "first_seen|desc"
  limit  = 100
}

# Query risks for a specific cloud provider
data "crowdstrike_cloud_risks" "aws_risks" {
  filter = "cloud_provider:'aws'+status:'open'"
  sort   = "severity|desc"
}

# Query risks for a specific account
data "crowdstrike_cloud_risks" "account_risks" {
  filter = "account_id:'123456789012'"
  limit  = 500
}

# Query risks by rule name
data "crowdstrike_cloud_risks" "specific_rule" {
  filter = "rule_name:*'S3 Bucket'*"
}

# Output example
output "high_severity_risks" {
  value = data.crowdstrike_cloud_risks.high_severity.risks
}

output "risk_count" {
  value = length(data.crowdstrike_cloud_risks.high_severity.risks)
}
```
