- Sensor update policies | Read


## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike"
    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}

# Get all sensor update policies
data "crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies" "all" {}

# Output IDs of policies with build turned off (null)
output "policy_ids_with_build_off" {
  value = [
    for policy in data.crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies.all.policies :
    policy.id if policy.build == null
  ]
}

# Output IDs of Linux policies with ARM64 builds turned off (null)
output "linux_policy_ids_with_arm64_off" {
  value = [
    for policy in data.crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies.all.policies :
    policy.id if policy.platform_name == "Linux" && policy.build_arm64 == null
  ]
}

# Output IDs of all policies with any build turned off (standard or ARM64)
output "all_policy_ids_with_builds_off" {
  value = setunion(
    [
      for policy in data.crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies.all.policies :
      policy.id if policy.build == null
    ],
    [
      for policy in data.crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies.all.policies :
      policy.id if policy.platform_name == "Linux" && policy.build_arm64 == null
    ]
  )
}

# Get only enabled policies
data "crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies" "enabled" {
  enabled = true
}

# Get policies for a specific platform
data "crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies" "windows_policies" {
  platform_name = "Windows"
}

# Get policies using FQL filter
data "crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies" "filtered" {
  filter = "enabled:true+platform_name:'Linux'"
}

# Get policies sorted by name
data "crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies" "sorted" {
  sort = "name.asc"
}

# Get specific policies by ID
data "crowdstrike_sensor_update_policies" "specific" {
  ids = [
    "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6",

## Schema

### Optional

- `created_by` (String) Filter policies by the user who created them. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `description` (String) Filter policies by description. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Filter policies by enabled status. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `filter` (String) FQL filter to apply to the sensor update policies query. When specified, only policies matching the filter will be returned. Cannot be used together with 'ids' or other filter attributes. Example: `platform_name:'Windows'`
- `ids` (List of String) List of sensor update policy IDs to retrieve. When specified, only policies with matching IDs will be returned. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or other filter attributes.
- `modified_by` (String) Filter policies by the user who last modified them. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `name` (String) Filter policies by name. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `platform_name` (String) Filter policies by platform_name (Windows, Linux, Mac). All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Cannot be used together with 'filter' or 'ids'.
- `sort` (String) Sort order for the results. Valid values include field names with optional '.asc' or '.desc' suffix. Example: 'name.asc', 'precedence.desc'
