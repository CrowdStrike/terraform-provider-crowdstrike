## Schema

### Optional

- `created_by` (String) Filter policies by the user who created them. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
- `description` (String) Filter policies by description. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Filter policies by enabled status. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
- `ids` (List of String) List of FileVantage policy IDs to retrieve. Cannot be used together with 'platform_names' or other filter attributes.
- `modified_by` (String) Filter policies by the user who last modified them. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
- `name` (String) Filter policies by name. All provided filter attributes must match for a policy to be returned (omitted attributes are ignored). Supports wildcard matching with '*' where '*' matches any sequence of characters until the end of the string or until the next literal character in the pattern is found. Multiple wildcards can be used in a single pattern. Matching is case insensitive. Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
- `platform_names` (Set of String) Filter policies by platform names. Valid values: Windows, Linux, Mac. Defaults to all. Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
- `sort` (String) Sort order for the results. Can be used with 'platform_names'. Valid values: 'precedence', 'created_timestamp', 'modified_timestamp', optionally followed by '.asc' or '.desc' (e.g., 'precedence.desc'). By default, '.asc' is used if no direction is specified. Cannot be used together with 'ids'.
