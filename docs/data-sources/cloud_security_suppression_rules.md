# crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rules (Data Source)

This data source retrieves detailed information about cloud security suppression rules. Suppression rules define criteria for automatically suppressing findings, such as IOMs, across your environment. Text-based fields (`name`, `description`) accept wildcards `*`. All fields query Falcon using logical AND. If FQL is defined, all other fields will be ignored. For advanced queries to further narrow your search, please use a Falcon Query Language (FQL) filter.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike"
    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}

# Get all suppression rules
data "crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rules" "all" {}

# Use FQL for advanced filtering
data "crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rules" "fql_advanced" {
  fql = "name:*'Production*'+suppression_reason:'false-positive'"
}

# Combine multiple filters (logical AND)
data "crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rules" "combined" {
  type   = "IOM"
  reason = "compensating-control"
  name   = "Security Exception*"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the suppression rule to search for. Wildcards are accepted (e.g., *suppression rule*).
- `disabled` (Boolean) Filter suppression rules by disabled status. When false, shows only active rules (non-expired). When true, shows all rules including expired ones. If not specified, shows all rules.
- `fql` (String) Falcon Query Language (FQL) filter for advanced suppression rule searches. FQL filter, allowed props: `name`, `description`, `subdomain`, `suppression_reason`, `disabled`
- `name` (String) Name of the suppression rule to search for. Wildcards are accepted (e.g., *suppression rule*).
- `reason` (String) Suppression reason to filter by. One of: accept-risk, compensating-control, false-positive.
- `type` (String) Type of suppression rule to filter by. This corresponds to the subdomain field in the API. One of: IOM.

### Read-Only

- `rules` (Attributes Set) List of cloud security suppression rules (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

### Nested Schema for `rules`

Read-Only:

- `asset_filter` (Attributes) Filter criteria for scope assets. Within each attribute, assets match if they contain ANY of the specified values (OR logic). Between different attributes, assets must match ALL specified attributes (AND logic). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--asset_filter))
- `comment` (String) Comment for suppression. This will be attached to the findings suppressed by this rule.
- `description` (String) Description of the suppression rule.
- `expiration_date` (String) Expiration date for suppression in RFC3339 format.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the suppression rule.
- `name` (String) Name of the suppression rule.
- `reason` (String) Reason for suppression. One of: accept-risk, compensating-control, false-positive.
- `rule_selection_filter` (Attributes) Filter criteria for rule selection. Within each attribute, rules match if they contain ANY of the specified values (OR logic). Between different attributes, rules must match ALL specified attributes (AND logic). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--rule_selection_filter))
- `type` (String) Type of suppression rule. One of: IOM.
