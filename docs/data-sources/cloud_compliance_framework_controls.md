# crowdstrike_cloud_compliance_framework_controls (Data Source)

This data source retrieves all or a subset of controls within compliance benchmarks. All non-FQL fields can accept wildcards `*` and query Falcon using logical AND. If FQL is defined, all other fields will be ignored. For advanced queries to further narrow your search, please use a Falcon Query Language (FQL) filter. For additional information on FQL filtering and usage, refer to the official CrowdStrike documentation: [Falcon Query Language (FQL)](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/d3c84a1b/falcon-query-language-fql)

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike"
    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}

# retrieve all controls under a named benchmark
data "crowdstrike_cloud_compliance_framework_controls" "all" {
  benchmark = "CIS 1.0.0 AWS Web Architecture"
}

# retrieve a single control within a benchmark by name
data "crowdstrike_cloud_compliance_framework_controls" "by_name" {
  name      = "Ensure subnets for the Web tier are created"
  benchmark = "CIS 1.0.0 AWS Web Architecture"
}

# retrieve a single control within a benchmark by requirement
data "crowdstrike_cloud_compliance_framework_controls" "by_requirement" {
  requirement = "2.1"
  benchmark   = "CIS 1.0.0 AWS Web Architecture"
}

# query by FQL filter
data "crowdstrike_cloud_compliance_framework_controls" "fql" {
  fql = "compliance_control_name:'Ensure subnets for the Web tier are created'"
}
