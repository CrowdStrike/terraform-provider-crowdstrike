# crowdstrike_ml_exclusion (Resource)

Manages machine learning exclusions for trusted file paths in the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform. At least one exclusion mode must be enabled via `exclude_detections` and/or `exclude_uploads`. Changes to `host_groups` require replacement.

## API Scopes

The following API scopes are required:

- Machine Learning Exclusions | Read & Write


## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike"
    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}

resource "crowdstrike_ml_exclusion" "example" {
  pattern            = "/tmp/build_artifacts/*"
  host_groups        = ["all"]
  exclude_detections = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `host_groups` (Set of String) The set of host group IDs this exclusion applies to. Use `all` to apply globally.
- `pattern` (String) The file path or pattern to exclude from machine learning detections.

### Optional

- `exclude_detections` (Boolean) Whether to exclude matching files from machine learning detections and preventions.
- `exclude_uploads` (Boolean) Whether to exclude matching files from cloud extraction/uploads.

### Read-Only

- `applied_globally` (Boolean) Whether Falcon reports this exclusion as globally applied.
- `created_by` (String) The user who created the exclusion.
- `created_on` (String) The timestamp when the exclusion was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the machine learning exclusion.
- `last_modified` (String) The timestamp when the exclusion was last modified.
- `last_updated` (String) The RFC850 timestamp of the last update to this resource by Terraform.
- `modified_by` (String) The user who last modified the exclusion.
- `regexp_value` (String) The regular expression representation of `pattern` generated by Falcon.
- `value_hash` (String) The hash of the configured exclusion pattern value.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# ML exclusions can be imported using their ID
terraform import crowdstrike_ml_exclusion.example 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```
