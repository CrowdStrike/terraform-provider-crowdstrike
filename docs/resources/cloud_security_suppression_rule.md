# crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rule (Resource)

A suppression rule defines criteria for automatically suppressing findings, such as IOMs, across your environment. When a finding matches a suppression rule's conditions, such as specific rule types, asset tags, or cloud accounts, the finding will be suppressed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike"
    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}

# Example 1: Simple suppression rule with rule name filter
resource "crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rule" "example" {
  name        = "Suppression Rule"
  type        = "IOM"
  reason      = "false-positive"
  description = "Suppress findings for IAM root user access key rule"
  comment     = "This is a known false positive in our development environment"

  rule_selection_filter = {
    names = ["IAM root user has an active access key"]
  }

  asset_filter = {
    regions = ["us-east-2"]
  }
}

# Example 2: More complex suppression rule with multiple filters
resource "crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rule" "multi_filter" {
  name        = "Multi-filter Suppression Rule"
  type        = "IOM"
  reason      = "accept-risk"
  description = "Suppress high and critical findings for specific cloud providers and regions"

  rule_selection_filter = {
    severities = ["critical", "high"]
    providers  = ["AWS", "Azure"]
  }

  asset_filter = {
    cloud_providers = ["aws", "azure"]
    regions         = ["us-west-1", "eastus"]
    tags            = ["environment=dev", "team=security"]
  }
}

# Example 3: Temporary suppression with expiration
resource "crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rule" "temporary" {
  name            = "Temporary Suppression"
  type            = "IOM"
  reason          = "compensating-control"
  expiration_date = "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"

  rule_selection_filter = {
    origins = ["Default"]
  }

  asset_filter = {
    account_ids = ["123456789012"]
  }
}

output "suppression_rule" {
  value = crowdstrike_cloud_security_suppression_rule.example
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the suppression rule
- `reason` (String) Reason for suppression. One of: accept-risk, compensating-control, false-positive.

### Optional

- `asset_filter` (Attributes) Filter criteria for scope assets. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--asset_filter))
- `comment` (String) Comment for suppression. This will be attached to the findings suppressed by this rule.
- `description` (String) Description of the suppression rule.
- `expiration_date` (String) Expiration date for suppression. If defined, must be in RFC3339 format (e.g., `2025-08-11T10:00:00Z`). Once set, this field cannot be cleared. The suppression rule will still exist after expiration and can be reset by updating the expiration date.
- `rule_selection_filter` (Attributes) Filter criteria for rule selection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule_selection_filter))
- `type` (String) Type of suppression rule. Defaults to IOM.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the suppression rule.

<a id="nestedatt--asset_filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `asset_filter`

Optional:

- `account_ids` (Set of String) Set of account IDs. An Asset will match if it belongs to an account included in this set.
- `cloud_group_ids` (Set of String) Set of cloud group IDs. An Asset will match if it belongs to a Cloud Group whose ID is included in this set.

- `resource_ids` (Set of String) Set of resource IDs. An Asset will match if its resource ID is included in this set.
- `resource_names` (Set of String) Set of resource names.  An Asset will match if its resource name is included in this set.
- `resource_types` (Set of String) Set of resource types. Examples: `AWS::S3::Bucket`, `compute.googleapis.com/Instance`, `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`. An Asset will match if its resource type is included in this set.
- `service_categories` (Set of String) Set of service categories. Examples: `Compute`, `Identity`, `Networking`.  An Asset will match if its cloud service category is included in this set.
- `tags` (Set of String) Set of tags. These must match the k=v format. An Asset will match if at least one of its tags is included in this set.

### Nested Schema for `rule_selection_filter`

Optional:

- `ids` (Set of String) Set of rule IDs. A rule will match if its ID is included in this set.
- `names` (Set of String) Set of rule names. A rule will match if its name is included in this set.
