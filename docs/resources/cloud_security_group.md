# crowdstrike_cloud_security_group (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage cloud security groups in the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform. Cloud security groups are organizational units that help group cloud resources and container images based on selectors for policy management and monitoring.

## API Scopes

The following API scopes are required:

- Cloud security | Read & Write

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike"
    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}

# Basic cloud security group with business context
resource "crowdstrike_cloud_security_group" "basic" {
  name            = "production-web-services"
  description     = "Production web services security group"
  business_impact = "high"
  business_unit   = "Engineering"
  environment     = "prod"
  owners          = ["team-lead@company.com", "security@company.com"]
}

# Cloud security group with cloud resource selectors
resource "crowdstrike_cloud_security_group" "aws_resources" {
  name        = "aws-production-resources"
  description = "AWS production resources"
  
  selectors {
    cloud_resources {
      cloud_provider = "aws"
      account_ids    = ["123456789012", "123456789013"]
      filters {

        tags   = ["Environment=Production", "Team=WebServices"]
      }
    }
  }
}
