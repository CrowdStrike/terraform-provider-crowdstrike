- Custom IOA Rules | Read & Write


## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    crowdstrike = {

    }
  }
}

provider "crowdstrike" {
  cloud = "us-2"
}
resource "crowdstrike_ioa_rule_group" "linux_monitoring" {
  name        = "Linux Security Monitoring"
  platform    = "Linux"
  description = "Custom IOA rules for monitoring suspicious Linux activity"
  comment     = "Managed by Terraform"
  enabled     = true

  rules = [

      action           = "Kill Process"
      enabled          = true
